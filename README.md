# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the assignments and projects completed as part of the course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence." The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques in the field of AI, based on the book "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following topics:

- What is AI? Intelligent agents.
- Defining intelligence and rationality in an agent.
- Methods of formalizing intelligence and rationality.
- Models for representing and using knowledge.
- Search algorithms and techniques.
- Logical reasoning and inference.
- Probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty.
- Decision-making under uncertainty.
- Hands-on experience programming artificially intelligent agents.
- Meta-reasoning in search.
## Project Summaries

### Hurricane Evacuation Problem

In this project, we tackled the Hurricane Evacuation Problem, focusing on path optimization. The implemented features include:

- Environment simulator and agents for path optimization.
- Greedy search agent, A* search agent, and real-time A* agent.
- Performance measurement based on goal achievement time using the "situated planning" approach.

### Cooperating and Adversarial Agents

In this project, we explored cooperating and adversarial agents in the context of the Hurricane Evacuation Problem. Key aspects of the project include:

- Support for adversarial, semi-cooperative, and fully cooperative games.
- Implementation of cutoff and heuristic static evaluation functions for each game.

### Reasoning under Uncertainty - Hurricane Evacuation Problem

This project focused on reasoning under uncertainty in the Hurricane Evacuation Problem. The implemented features include:

- Probabilistic reasoning using Bayes networks.
- Construction of Bayes networks based on given scenarios.
- Probabilistic reasoning to answer questions about blockages, evacuees, and weather.

### Sequential Decision Making under Uncertainty - Belief-state MDP

In this project, we addressed sequential decision making under uncertainty using belief-state MDP in the context of the Hurricane Evacuation Problem. The key features include:

- Handling a variant of the Canadian traveler problem.
- Construction of policies using belief-state MDP for decision-making.
- Conducting simulations and displaying graphs and optimal actions based on the computed policy.

## Repository Structure

- Each project has its own directory containing the relevant code and files.
- The projects are implemented in Python, adhering to the requirements and guidelines specified in the course syllabus.

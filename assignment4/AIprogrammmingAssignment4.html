<H2>Hurricane Evacuation Problem</H2>
        </CENTER>
<p>

<H3>Goals </H3>
<P>
Sequential decision making under uncertainty using 
belief-state MDP for decision-making: the Hurrucane Evacuation  problem.
(This is an obscure variant of the Canadian traveler problem.)

<H3>Hurricane Evacuation Decision Problem - Domain Description</H3>

<P>
The domain description is similar to that described in assignment 1,
except that again  we do not know the locations of the blocakges.
For simplicity, however, we will assume that the blockages occur independently, (i.e. that all brittle vertices have
already been broken, but we don't know for certain if they were brittle) with a known
given probability. They are revealed with certainty when the agent reaches 
a neigbouring vertex. 

<P>
Thus, in the current problem to be solved, we are given a weighted
undirected graph, where each vertex has a known probability of being blocked.
These distributions are jointly independent.
The agent's only actions are traveling between vertices.
Traversal times are the weight of the edge.
Also for simplicity, we will assume only one agent, starting at s, and only target vertex t
with people to be saved.
The problem is to find a policy that saves the people in as short a time as possible (in expectation).

<P>
The graph can be provided in a manner similar to previous assignments, for example:


<pre>
#V 5    ; number of vertices n in graph (from 1 to n)

#E1 1 2 W3   ; Edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2, weight 3
#E2 2 3 W2   ; Edge from vertex 2 to vertex 3, weight 2
#E3 3 4 W3   ; Edge from vertex 3 to vertex 4, weight 3, probability of blockage 0.3
#E4 4 5 W1   ; Edge from vertex 4 to vertex 5, weight 1
#E5 2 4 W4   ; Edge from vertex 2 to vertex 4, weight 4

#B 2 0.3     ; Blocakge at vertex 2 with probability 0.3
#B 3 0.8     ; Blockage at vertex 3 with probability 0.8

#Start 1
#Target 5
</pre>

<P>
The start and goal (target) vertices, should be determined via some
form of user input (as in the file, or querying the user). For example,
in the above graph the start vertex is 1, and the goal (target) vertex is 5.
You should assume that the start and target vertices are never blocked, and that there
is in addition an edge between them that has a very high cost (say 10000).

<H3>Solution method</H3>

<P>
The Canadian traveller problem is known to be PSPACE-complete (and it is likely that the
uncertain Hurricane Evacuation problem is also PSPACE-complete) so you will
be required to solve only very small instances. We will require that the
entire belief space be stored in memory explicitly, and thus impose a limit
of at most  20 vertices with at most 10 possible blockages.
Your program should initialize
belief space value functions and use a form of value iteration
(discussed in class) to compute the value function for
the belief states. Maintain the
optimal action during the value iteration for each belief state,
so that you have the optimal policy at convergence.


<H3>Requirements </H3>

<P>
Your program should read the data, including the parameters
(start and shelter vertices). You should construct the policy, and
present it in some way. Provide at least the following types of output:

<OL>
<LI> A full printout of the value of each belief-state, and the
     optimal action in that belief state, if it exists. 
     (Print something that indicates so if this state is irregular,
     e.g. if it is unreachable).
<LI> Run a sequence of simulations. That is, generate a graph instance
     (blockage locations) according to the  distributions, and run the
     agent through this graph based on the (optimal) policy computed 
     by your algorithm. Display the graph instance and sequence of actions.
     Allow the user to run additional simulations, for a newly generated
     instance in each case.
</OL>



<H3>Deliverables </H3>

<OL>
<LI> Source code and executable files of programs.
<LI> Explanation of the method employed in your algorithm.
<LI> Non-trivial example runs on at least 2 scenarios,
including the input and output.
<LI> Submit makefile and short description on how to run your program.
</OL>

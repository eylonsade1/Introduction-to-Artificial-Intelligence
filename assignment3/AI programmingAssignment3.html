<H3>Goals </H3>
<P>
Probabilistic reasoning using 
Bayes networks, with scenarios similar to the
hurricane evacuation problem environment of assignment 1.

<H3>Uncerain Hurricane Evacuation Problem - Domain Description</H3>

<P>

As they try to find their best path, in the real world, evacuation forces may be unable
to tell in advance which vertices are blocked and where are there people to be evacuated, if any.
There may be evidence which can help, but one cannot be sure until
the vertex in question is observed from a nearby location! Not knowing the blockages and
evacuee contents in advance makes it hard
to plan an optimal path, so reasoning about the unknown is crucial.
We know that it is more likely for people to need evacuation near or at blocked vertices,
and vertices are more likely to be blocked if the weather is bad.
In this version of the problem, we will consider only binary-valued occupation
of vertices, i.e. whether it contains people to be evacuated, or not.
<P>

Thus we have a binary random variable B(v)
standing in blockage at vertex v,
one binary random variable Ev(v) standing in for "people to evacuate" at each vertex v,
and a 3-valued variable W standing for the weather: mild, stormy, and extreme.
The blocking events are assumed independent given the weather, with known distributions given
weather. In the input we are given for each vertex that a probablity that it is blocked given mild
weather. Thos probability is doubled for stormy weather, and tripled for extreme weather
(up to a maximum of 1 obviously)

The people variables are noisy-or distributed given the blocakges at neighboring vertices,
with qi = max(1, p1*w(e)) where e is the edge between the vertices.
There is also a qs = p2 for the effect of blockage in the same vertex.
P1 and p2 are parameters to be given in the file or queried from the user.

<P>
All in all, you have 3 types of variables (BN nodes): blockages (one for each vertex)
weather (only one global variable) and evacuees present (one for each vertex).
<P>

In your program, a file specifies the geometry (graph), and parameters such as P(B(v)=true)|mild weather).
Then, you enter some locations where blockages, or evacuees are 
reported either present or absent (and the rest remain unknown), or the weather.
This is the evidence in the problem.

Once evidence is instantiated, you need to perform reasoning about the likely locations of 
blockages, and evacuees, and the weather (all probabilities below "given the evidence"):

<OL>
<LI> What is the probability that each of the vertices contains evacuees?
<LI> What is the probability that each of the vertices is blocked?
<LI> What is the distribution of the weather variable?
<LI> What is the probability that a certain path (set of edges) is free from blockages?
(Note that the distributions of blockages in vertices are NOT necessarily independent.)
<LI> What is the path from a given location to a goal that has the highest probability of
being free from blockages? (bonus)
</OL>

<P>
Input can be as an ASCII
file, similar to graph descriptions in previous assignments, for example:

<pre>
#V 4          ; number of vertices n in graph (from 1 to n)

#V 1 F 0.2    ; Vertex 1, probability blockage given mild weather 0.2
#V 2 F 0.3    ; Vertex 2, probability blockage given mild weather 0.3
              ; Either assume blockage probability 0 by default,
              ; or make sure to specify this probability for all vertices.

#E1 1 2 W1 ; Edge1 between vertices 1 and 2, weight 1
#E2 2 3 W3 ; Edge2 between vertices 2 and 3, weight 3
#E3 3 4 W3 ; Edge3 between vertices 3 and 4, weight 3
#E4 2 4 W4 ; Edge4 between vertices 2 and 4, weight 4

#W 0.1 0.4 0.5 ; Prior distribution over weather: 0.1 for mild, 0.4 for stormy, 0.5 for extreme
</pre>


<P>
 
<H3>Requirements </H3>

<P>
(Part I) Your program should read the data, including the distribution
parameters, which are defined as above.
The program should construct a Bayes network according
to the scenario.
The program should also allow for an output of the Bayes network constructed
for the scenario.

<P>
For example, part of the output for the above graph,  would be:
<pre>
WEATHER:
  P(mild) = 0.1
  P(stormy) = 0.4
  P(extreme) = 0.5
	
VERTEX 1:
  P(blocked|mild) = 0.2
  P(blocked|stormy) = 0.4
  P(blocked|extreme) = 0.6

  P(Evacuees|Blockage 1, Blockage 2) = 0.94
  P(Evacuees|not Blockage 1, Blockage 2) = 0.8
  P(Evacuees|Blockage 1, not Blockage 2) = 0.7
  P(Evacuees|not Blockage 1, not Blockage 2) = 0

VERTEX 2:
etc.

</pre>

<P>
(Part II) After the network is fully constructed, you should support querying the
user for a set of evidence. We do this
by reading one piece of evidence at a time (e.g. "Blockage reported at vertex 2", and then
"Evacuees reported at vertex 1" etc.).
The online interactive operations your program  should support are:
<IL>
<LI> Reset evidence list to empty.
<LI> Add piece of evidence to evidence list.
<LI> Do probabilistic reasoning (1, 2, 3, 4), or (1,2,3,4,5), whichever your program supports, 
and report the results.
<LI> Quit.
</IL>

<P>
Probabilistic reasoning should be done
in order to answer the questions on
distribution of blockages, etc., and report on the answers,
including all the posterior probabilities. 

You may use any algorithm in the literature that supports solution of
BNs, including simple enumerarion,
variable elimination, polytree propagation, or sampling.
